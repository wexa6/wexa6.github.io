## Solution
My journey started just like any OSINT investigation: with a simple search. When you're given a unique username or handle like `"linus-r8000"`, the first logical step is to see where it exists online. A quick search on Google immediately pointed me towards a GitHub profile. The top result was a repository named `linus-r8000/the-final-checkpoint`, which sounded very promising.

### The Red Herring

Diving into the repository, the first thing I found was a peculiar image file named` DONT OPEN THIS.jpeg`. In the world of CTFs, a file name like that is practically an invitation.

Inside was an image of a red fish. This absolutely screamed **"red herring."** *It's a classic trick designed to make you waste time on a dead end.* I briefly considered steganography or other image-based puzzles, but my gut told me it was a distraction. For a **"medium"** difficulty challenge, the answer was unlikely to be hidden in plain sight like this. It was time to dig deeper.

###  Uncovering Hidden History

After hours of searching in this small github profile, I remembered that a repository's current state isn't the full story. *The real gems are often buried in its history.* I navigated to the `repository's activity` to check for commits, deletions, and any other changes.

Checking the history of these deleted branches or related commits gave me two different links to a protected file on Cryptpad.

Now new objective was clear: find the password to unlock these files.

### The Next Rabbit Hole

With the password hunt now underway, I went back to the `linus-r8000` GitHub profile to search for more clues. I had explored the repository, but what about the rest of the profile? I clicked on the `Projects` tab, a place where developers organize their work and often leave notes. I found a closed project.

Tucked away inside was a note containing Morse code. A secret message! This had to be it.

I quickly copied the code and pasted it into [morsecode.world](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html).

Oh nOoo... I'd been Rick-rolled.

A classic CTF troll. It was a funny distraction, but a disappointment nonetheless. The challenge creator was definitely having some fun. I knew the real clue had to be lurking somewhere else in this same closed project.

###  The Real Clue

I went back to the closed project, this time, I examined the `"project details"` or the `project's README` section. The Rick-roll was a flashy distraction, but something more subtle was likely hidden in the text. And there it was—a very suspicious string of Chinese characters.

```
籙籪籼籼粀籸类籭 籲籼 籵籝米籕籜籝籊籖粀籱籌籝
```

After some time of searching and using google translate gave me absolute gibberish. This is a strong indicator that you're not dealing with a translatable language, but with encoded data cleverly disguised as text.

### Decoding the Message

My next thought was to treat each character as a number. I used a simple Python script to convert each character into its Unicode value

```python
text = "籙籪籼籼粀籸类籭 籲籼 籵籝米籕籜籝籊籖粀籱籌籝"
for c in text:
    print(hex(ord(c)), end=" ")
```
This gave me: 
```
0x7c59 0x7c6a 0x7c7c 0x7c7c 0x7c80 0x7c78 0x7c7b 0x7c6d 0x20 0x7c72 0x7c7c 0x20 0x7c75 0x7c5d 0x7c73 0x7c55 0x7c5c 0x7c5d 0x7c4a 0x7c56 0x7c80 0x7c71 0x7c4c 0x7c5d
```
Low bytes:
```
0x59 0x6a 0x7c 0x7c 0x80 0x78 0x7b 0x6d 0x20 0x72 0x7c 0x20 0x75 0x5d 0x73 0x55 0x5c 0x5d 0x4a 0x56 0x80 0x71 0x4c 0x5d
```
I took these bytes to my favorite digital multitool, [Cyberchef](https://cyberchef.io/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')&input=MHg1OSAweDZhIDB4N2MgMHg3YyAweDgwIDB4NzggMHg3YiAweDZkIDB4MjAgMHg3MiAweDdjIDB4MjAgMHg3NSAweDVkIDB4NzMgMHg1NSAweDVjIDB4NWQgMHg0YSAweDU2IDB4ODAgMHg3MSAweDRjIDB4NWQK)

Converting the low bytes from hex to ASCII gave me this:
```
Yj||x{m r| u]sU\]JVqL]
```
This was still garbage, but it was structured garbage xDDD

> ChatGPT told me:

> Treat it as a substitution for letter (using ROT13, ROT47)
> ROT47 especially fits, since the string includes lots of printable symbols (| { ] \).

### THE END

Back in Cyberchef, I started bruteforcing rotation ciphers. I loaded the garbage text into the input and applied the `ROT47` recipe.

> Something to note here that the `Password` is written without the `"w"` and it's intended so you can predict the letter off from the password `lTjLSTAM.hCT` 
> which will be at the end `lTjLSTAMwhCT`

With the final password in hand, I went back to the two Cryptpad links mentioned early. I entered the password, and it worked!
