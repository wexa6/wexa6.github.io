### Introduction.

#### *Overview:*

> Zeus, also known as ***Zbot***, is one of the most notorious banking trojans ever discovered.

> The Zeus Trojan was first spotted in 2007 when it was caught stealing sensitive data from systems owned by the ***U.S. Department of Transportation****.*

> Its creator is believed to be ***Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev***, a Russian hacker, who remains one of the FBI's most wanted cybercriminals with a $3 million bounty on his head.

*Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev*

> Zeus was responsible for infecting millions of systems worldwide, causing significant financial losses to individuals and organizations.

> Despite law enforcement efforts to dismantle its infrastructure, Zeus's source code was leaked in 2011, leading to the development of numerous variants that continue to influence modern banking malware.

> *Some notable stats about Zeus from the* ***Zeus Museum*** *(*[*https://zeusmuseum.com/*](https://zeusmuseum.com/)*):*

> - ***573+ known versions*** *of the Zeus Trojan*

> - ***36 known families*** *(only 1 active at present)*

### *Analysis Tools:*

> To analyze the Zeus banking trojan, I followed a structured approach that combined both static and dynamic analysis techniques. This methodology allowed me to examine the malware's properties, capabilities, and behavior in a controlled environment.

#### **Static Analysis**

> Static analysis was performed before executing the malware to gather information about the malware
> 1.    [**VirusTotal**](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) Scanned the file against multiple antivirus engines to check existing detections.
> 2.    [**PEStudio**](https://pestudio.en.lo4d.com/windows) Identified suspicious indicators such as imports, strings, and file characteristics.
> 3.    [**CAPA**](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/releases) Detected known capabilities embedded in the malware.
> 4.    [**Cutter**](https://cutter.re/) Used for reverse engineering to inspect the code, logic, and control flow.

#### **Dynamic Analysis**

> Dynamic analysis was then conducted in a sandboxed environment to observe Zeus's behavior.
> 5.    [**INetSim**](https://www.inetsim.org/) Simulated fake internet to capture communication attempts without reaching external servers.
> 6.    [**Wireshark**](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) Monitored and analyzed network traffic generated by the malware.
> 7.    [**Procmon**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) Tracked file system, registry, and process activities to detect modifications.

### **Environment Setup**

> The analysis was conducted in a virtualized environment using **VirtualBox** to ensure isolation and prevent accidental infection of the host machine.

> Two virtual machines were configured:

-   **Windows 10 VM (Victim Machine):**

This system was used to execute the Zeus sample and monitor its behavior. All dynamic analysis tools, including Procmon, Wireshark, and YARA, were installed here. The Windows machine acted as the primary target for infection.

-   **Ubuntu VM (INetSim Server):**

This machine was configured to run **INetSim**, which simulated common internet services. It intercepted and responded to Zeus's communication attempts, allowing the capture of its C2 traffic without requiring a live internet connection.

> The two VMs were connected through an **NAT network**, ensuring the malware could communicate only with the simulated services provided by the Ubuntu server. This setup created a safe and controlled lab environment for both static and dynamic analysis of the Zeus trojan.

*Zeus trojan NAT network*

* * * * *

**The Zeus Trojan sample used for this analysis was obtained from the [Zoo Malware Repository](https://github.com/abuisa/MalwareZoo/tree/master/malwares/Binaries/ZeusBankingVersion_26Nov2013)**

* * * * *

### **Static Analysis Phase**

The investigation started with static analysis, starting with an examination of the sample in PEStudio.

#### PEstudio

An immediate observation was the malware's `raw size (251,904 bytes)` and its `virtual size (250,379 bytes)` were nearly identical.

*Which suggests this file is not packed.*

![](/assets/img/zeus/2.jpeg)
*The raw size (251904 byte) and virtual size (250379 byte) are very close*

Further inspection of the malware's **strings** within PEStudio revealed 17 functions flagged as suspicious.

These APIs can provide early clues into the malware's intended capabilities.

![](/assets/img/zeus/3.jpeg)

While examining the strings in PEStudio, an unusual pattern was discovered.

The string table contains numerous junk strings that appear to be random words joined together. These suspicious strings are mixed in with legitimate WinAPI function names.

I think this method is likely intended to confuse analysts and make it more difficult to identify the program's real functionality through static analysis.

Checking the malware's libraries reveals that the sample links against three core Windows libraries:

> `SHLWAPI.dll, KERNEL32.dll, and USER32.dll`

These libraries suggest the malware relies on core Windows system functions for execution.

![](/assets/img/zeus/5.jpeg)
*SHLWAPI --- KERNEL32 --- USER32 DLLs*

An inspection of the executable's manifest resource in PEStudio, revealed a specific configuration for its requested execution level.

<requestedExecutionLevel level='asInvoker' uiAccess='false'/>

> From a malware analysis perspective, this is a **Defense Evasion** technique. By not requesting higher privileges, the malware avoids triggering a User Account Control (UAC) prompt, which would alert the user to a potentially suspicious action.

> This allows the malware to execute silently and establish an initial foothold on the system using only standard user-level permissions.

![](/assets/img/zeus/6.jpeg)
*Defense Evasion technique*

The Zeus sample has a high **`entropy of 6.982`**, indicating a large amount of random-looking data.

This is likely caused by the numerous junk strings embedded in the file, which were identified earlier.

![](/assets/img/zeus/7.jpeg)
*Entropy -> 6.982*

This concludes the analysis with PEStudio.

* * * * *

#### CAPA tool

CAPA was used to get an overview of the malware’s tactics, According to **CAPA**, the malware is capable of obfuscating its own files, checking for sandboxes and virtual machines, and encrypting data.

These features are all designed to make analysis more difficult.

**ATT&CK Tactic: DEFENSE EVASION**

-   [Obfuscated Files or Information [T1027]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)
-   [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: System Checks [T1497.001]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/001/)

**MBC Objective:**

-   `Virtual Machine Detection [B0009]`
-   `Obfuscated Files or Information: Encryption-Standard Algorithm [E1027.m05]`

**Capabilities Identified:**

-   Reference anti-VM strings targeting VMware
-   Encrypt data using Chaskey
-   Resolve function by parsing PE exports (2 matches)

![](/assets/img/zeus/8.jpeg)
*CAPA output*

* * * * *

#### Cutter

The next step was to analyze the executable in the Cutter disassembler. 

*(Note: I won’t go too deep into reverse engineering here. My focus will just be on any strange patterns that stand out in the code.)*

Analyzing the code from its entry point, the first notable feature discovered was a large delay loop.

![](/assets/img/zeus/9.jpeg)
*GetTickCount is called 524,288 times*

The code initializes the **esi** register with the value `0x80000` (524,288) and then enters a loop that repeatedly calls the GetTickCount API until the **esi** decrements to zero.

> This behavior is an anti-analysis technique corresponding to [MITRE ATT&CK T1497.003: Time-Based Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003/).

The loop's purpose is to delay execution, which can cause automated sandboxes to time out and terminate analysis before the malware's primary payload is activated. It also serves to complicate the manual debugging.

* * * * *

***This concludes the static analysis phase.***

> Key findingsinclude its ability to bypass UAC, a time-delay loop to evade sandboxes, and heavily obfuscated code designed to dynamically resolve APIs and steal data from active windows.
* * * * *

***The next phase will involve dynamic analysis to observe ZEUS behavior in action.***

* * * * *

### Setup & Configure INetSim

We will set up the INetSim server on an Ubuntu machine.

INetSim simulates common internet services, allowing malware to interact with a controlled "fake internet" while we monitor its connections.

``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install inetsim
```

#### Configure INetSim

Main configuration file: `/etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf`

Common settings:

-   **IP address** set it to `0.0.0.0` to be able to listen on all interfaces

`service_bind_address 0.0.0.0`

-   **DNS simulation**

`dns_default_ip 192.168.10.16`   #(replace with Ubuntu VM IP)

This ensures that any domain the malware attempts to contact will be redirected to the INetSim server.

-   Runing the INetSim

```
sudo inetsim
```

![](/assets/img/zeus/10.jpeg)
*INetSim running*

* * * * *

#### On the analysis machine

-   Go to **Network & Internet settings → Change adapter options**
-   Right-click your active network adapter → **Properties**
-   Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** → **Properties**
-   **Preferred DNS server** = IP of your INetSim VM (`192.168.10.16`)

![](/assets/img/zeus/11.jpeg)
*IPv4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties*

To confirm everything was working, I opened a browser and went to google.com.

The browser showed the INetSim default page, which means the DNS redirection was successful.

![](/assets/img/zeus/12.jpeg)
*INetSim default page*

* * * * *

#### Challenges Faced During Setup

When starting INetSim, it failed to launch the DNS service and produced a "deprecated method" error.
```
deprecated method; prefer start_server() at /usr/share/perl5/INetSim/DNS.pm line 69. 
Attempt to start Net::DNS::Nameserver in a subprocess at /usr/share/perl5/INetSim/DNS.pm line 69.
```
Since INetSim hasn't been updated in years (last release 2020), this warning is expected on newer systems.

To fix this, I followed this [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MalwareAnalysis/comments/1iise7n/comment/mt5hcjs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

INetSim was downgraded to version 1.37, which is known to be more stable. This solution allowed the service to start correctly.

* * * * *
### **Dynamic Analysis Phase**

#### Preparing for Dynamic Analysis

Before executing the sample, a snapshot of the analysis VM was created. This provides a clean restore point, ensuring the analysis is both safe and repeatable.

![](/assets/img/zeus/13.jpeg)
*Before running the malware snapshot*

* * * * *

#### Monitoring malware behavior

Now, I was ready to execute the malware. To monitor its behavior, I started Wireshark for network analysis and Procmon for system monitoring just before running the sample.

**`The malware executed in 2025-09-02 16:07:37`**

![](/assets/img/zeus/14.jpeg)
*Running Wireshark*

The first behavior observed after running the malware was the deletion of the original executable file from its folder.

This act of self-deletion is a common stealth technique used to remove the initial infection vector.

![](/assets/img/zeus/15.jpeg)
*Empty folder after running the executable*

* * * * *

#### Procmon Investigation

Using process tree view, we can see that the malware spawned a new process named InstallFlashPlayer.exe in the `\AppData\Local\Temp` directory. It also launched cmd.exe.

The creation of this disguised file in a temporary location is a key indicator of the malware's attempt to establish persistence.

![](/assets/img/zeus/16.jpeg)
*C:\Users\wexa\AppData\Local\Temp\InstallFlashPlayer.exe*

To isolate the relevant events from the extensive data captured by Procmon, specific filters were applied. The view was configured to include only events where:
-   The Process Name contains `invoice`
-   The Path contains `\Local\Temp`
![](/assets/img/zeus/17.jpeg)
*Procmon filters*

##### Dropped Files

After filtering the Procmon logs, the first notable action was the malware creating a file named `msimg32.dll` in the `\AppData\Local\Temp` folder.
![](/assets/img/zeus/18.jpeg)
*msimg32.dll*

A quick search confirms that `msimg32.dll` is a normal Windows file, but it is supposed to be located in `C:\Windows\System32`, not in a temporary folder.
![](/assets/img/zeus/19.jpg)
*Searching the Dll in Google*

The msimg32.dll and InstallFlashPlayer.exe that were created in the `Temp` folder were initially hidden. Standard commands and the File Explorer could not see it.
![](/assets/img/zeus/20.jpg)
*msimg32.dll & InstallFlashPlayer.exe are hidden*

This is because the malware flagged them as a "Hidden protected operating system" files. This is a common trick to keep its components from being easily discovered.

To be able to see them I had to disable *Hide protected operating system files* in 

`Control panel > Appearance and Personalization > File Explorer Options`
![](/assets/img/zeus/21.jpg)
*File explorer options*

After revealing the hidden files, hashes were calculated for both `InstallFlashPlayer.exe` and `msimg32.dll` and submitted to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) for reputation analysis. The results were highly indicative of a specific evasion technique:

![](/assets/img/zeus/23.jpg){:width="750px"} | ![](/assets/img/zeus/24.jpg){:width="750px"} 

In this technique, a legitimate, benign executable is used as a loader. When executed, it loads a malicious DLL that has been placed in the same directory and given a name that the application is expected to load (in this case, `msimg32.dll`).

* * * * *

Returning to Process Monitor, the analysis focused on file creation events by filtering for the `CreateFile` operation. This revealed that the malware established a persistence location using an obfuscated directory name.

A file was created at:

`C:\Users\wexa\AppData\Local\Google\Desktop\Install\{7af4fd0b-ff88-5ccf-b2b9-96b51cb05e63}\❤≸⋙\Ⱒ☠⍨\ﯹ๛\{7af4fd0b-ff88-5ccf-b2b9-96b51cb05e63}\` with the conspicuous name `exe.etadpUelgooG`.
![](/assets/img/zeus/25.jpg)
*Strange folder name*

Navigating to it's directory I found others dropped files by the malware which can be used for persistence
![](/assets/img/zeus/26.jpg)
*4 dropped files by the malware in strange directory*

Checking the `GoogleUpdate.exe` hash, it seems that it has the same SHA256 hash as the malware executable

-   Original Sample SHA256:  `69E966E730557FDE8FD84317CDEF1ECE00A8BB3470C0B58F3231E170168AF169`
-   GoogleUpdate.exe SHA256: `69E966E730557FDE8FD84317CDEF1ECE00A8BB3470C0B58F3231E170168AF169`

![](/assets/img/zeus/27.jpg)
*Same hash as the malware sample*

This confirms that `GoogleUpdate.exe` is a direct copy of the initial payload. The malware's primary persistence strategy is to copy itself to a new location and rename itself to masquerade as a legitimate process. This is a classic `Defense Evasion` and `Persistence` technique, corresponding to [MITRE ATT&CK T1036.005: Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/).

* * * * *
##### Registry Activity

Next, I examined the registry changes made by the malware by filtering the RegSetValue operation which shows write key operations.

![](/assets/img/zeus/28.jpg)
*The first key here "Google Update"*

**First**, the malware ensures it runs every time the user logs in. It does this by adding an entry to the well-known `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` key in the registry. It cleverly names this entry `Google Update` to look legitimate.
![](/assets/img/zeus/29.jpg)
*Suspicious registry value*

**Second**, the malware tampers with the computer's internet settings, it modifies several registry keys that control how the computer connects to the internet, including *proxy* settings and *trusted zones*.

This is a defense evasion tactic to ensure it can communicate with its command-and-control servers without being blocked by local network security.
![](/assets/img/zeus/30.jpg)
*ProxyBypass, IntranetName, AutoDetect*

The dynamic analysis using Process Monitor has concluded, identifying several dropped files and registry modifications that shows the malware's primary infection and persistence mechanisms.

#### Wireshark Investigation

The investigation of network traffic captured in Wireshark began by analyzing `DNS queries` made by the malware. The first notable network activity was a standard DNS query for the domain `j.maxmind.com`.

![](/assets/img/zeus/31.jpg)
*j.maxmind.com*

I researched this domain using the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/), looking at historical data from around the time the malware was created (late 2013). This research confirmed that MaxMind is a well-known service used to identify the geographic location of an IP address.

![](/assets/img/zeus/32.jpg){:width="550px"}
*j.maxmind.com snapshots*

![](/assets/img/zeus/33.jpg)
*2013-11-23 snapshot*

This finding means the malware was performing a location check. It was likely trying to determine the country and city of the infected machine. Malware does this to make sure it's attacking a user in a specific country or to avoid detection by not running in certain locations.

Which maybe related to [System Location Discovery (MITRE ATT&CK T1614)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614/).

![](/assets/img/zeus/34.jpg)
*Old snapshot from 2004-02-08*

Further Investigation I noticed that the malware was sending many malformed DNS packets to IP `85.114.128.127`
![](/assets/img/zeus/35.jpg)
*6 Malformed Packets sent to IP 85.114.128.127*

I looked up this IP using this site [whatismyipaddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/85.114.128.127) and found that it's located in Germany. Although the IP itself isn't currently flagged as malicious, this behavior is very suspicious. 
![](/assets/img/zeus/36.jpg)
*What is my ip address website*

Next, the network traffic showed the malware trying to connect to the official Adobe Flash download server `fpdownload.macromedia.com` to download a Flash Player update.

This confirms that the benign `InstallFlashPlayer.exe` is running as intended, while the malicious code resides within the side-loaded `msimg32.dll`.
![](/assets/img/zeus/37.jpg)
*The malware connecting to adobe server*

Our INetSim server intercepted this request and responded with its default HTML page, as it did not host the requested file.
![](/assets/img/zeus/38.jpg)
*INetSim responding to the request*

* * * * *

> *Finally as we can see, the legitimate InstallFlashPlayer.exe process continues to run, occasionally generating normal network traffic by trying to contact Adobe's update servers `fpdownload.macromedia.com`, creating a smokescreen of legitimate activity,*

> *While this is happening, the real trojan — the malicious `msimg32.dll`— is running silently in the background, monitoring the user's web browsing and stealing their credentials.*

* * * * *
